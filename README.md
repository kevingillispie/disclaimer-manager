## Description

Internet marketing agencies often have multiple clients with multiple offers advertised in multiple places. Instead of updating each disclaimer individually, this simple web app stores each disclaimer in a single database table where disclaimers can be created, read, updated, and deleted. A short script is then generated for placement on websites and landing pages that retrieves the selected disclaimers on page load and displays the disclaimer's text in an element packaged with the script. 

Whenever the verbiage of a disclaimer needs updating, instead of going to each landing page individually, this web app provides a centralized location to update all instances of a disclaimer.

Proper attribution between a disclaimer and its associated offer is vitally important. This web app generates asterisks and daggers in a predictable sequence and appends them to the text of each disclaimer selected for a given offer.
